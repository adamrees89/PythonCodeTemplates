# PythonCodeTemplates
Repository of code templates

This is a public repository of Python code snippets gathered from various places around the web, they are mostly just snippets and are to be used as part of a wider codebase.

I will try to credit the original author where possible, but if I cannot find the author then I will credit as A.N.Other and will be happy to stand corrected.
